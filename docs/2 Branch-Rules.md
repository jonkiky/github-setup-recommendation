# Branch Rules

## Released Tag Protection

A safeguard mechanism that ensures released tags remain immutable after being created. Once a tag is marked as released, it cannot be recreated, deleted, or modified, preserving the integrity and consistency of versioned releases.

In Branch Rules, enable :
- Restrict creations
- Restrict creations
- Restrict creations
- Block force pushes

## Development Branch Protection

Development Branch Protection enforces secure workflows by restricting branch creation/deletion, requiring pull requests with approvals, status checks, CodeQL scanning, blocking force pushes, and AI review via Copilot.

In Branch Rules, enable :
- Restrict branch creations
- Restrict branch deletions
- Require a pull request before merging
- Require at least 1 approval for pull requests
- Block force pushes
- Require status checks to pass before merging
- Require CodeQL code scanning results
- Automatically request pull request review from GitHub Copilot
